description: "Use when asking whether a green test suite can be trusted — before leaning on it for a refactor, upgrade, or release: sweep for skipped and quarantined growth, assertion-free and tautological tests, mocks asserting mocks, rubber-stamped snapshots, and coverage that executes without checking, optionally probing a sample with deliberate mutations. Read-only findings with citations, no score, no certificate. Not for fixing failures (keep-green), authoring tests (tdd), or reviewing a diff (implementation-review)."

# Test Trust Audit

The suite is green; this skill asks whether green means anything — an evidence-led sweep for the ways green lies, read-only by default, certifying nothing. Invocation: `/test-trust-audit` or `$test-trust-audit`.

A sweep over one existing green suite for the hollow-green patterns: skip and quarantine drift, assertion-free tests, tautological tests, mocks asserting mocks, snapshot rubber-stamping, and coverage that executes without checking — plus an optional, opt-in, strictly contained mutation probe that samples whether the suite catches a deliberate behavior change. The product is a findings list with file:line evidence, ordered by how badly each finding undermines trust. It fixes nothing, scores nothing, and certifies nothing.

## The owned job

This owns the **evidentiary audit of an existing green suite**: whether "tests pass" is proof or noise. No neighbor owns it. `keep-green` drives a suite you just broke back to green — it never asks whether green is honest; `tdd` authors new tests test-first and prevents these defects at writing time; `implementation-review` (when `review-family:implementation-review` is available) reviews a completed change against a spec plus a diff; a scored repo-wide backlog is `tech-debt-scan`'s. Each composes with this skill; none reads the suite you already have and reports what its green actually proves.

Its value is time-asymmetric and high-stakes. A hollow suite silently converts every future "tests pass" into a false proof, and the cost lands exactly when someone leans on it — the refactor shipped on green that checked nothing, the upgrade "verified" by tests that assert mocks. The value is the complete hollow-green sweep now, while the human is spared composing the checklist and reading hundreds of test bodies.

## Mixed skill — apply the bar per part

- **Firm (trust).** The six finding classes swept every run, file:line evidence on every finding, the mutation probe's containment protocol, the no-score/no-certificate close, and the read-only default. These have right/wrong answers and a predictable shape; a skipped class, an evidence-free finding, or a mutation left behind is a defect — the value is the complete, cited pass, not a plausible one.
- **Provoked (judgment).** Whether a mock boundary is legitimate isolation or the test testing itself; whether a snapshot is a reviewed contract or a rubber stamp; which functions are load-bearing enough to earn a mutation sample. Posed as forcing questions keyed to this suite; never answered with a generic "mocks are bad", never hardened into a checklist filled in to feel done.

## Shape — the sweep

Six classes, swept every run — each with its detection route and its judgment question:

- **Skip/quarantine drift.** Count and age the skipped, expected-fail, and disabled tests — `skip`, `xfail`, `todo`, `.skip`, quarantine lists (pytest `skip`/`xfail`, jest `.skip`/`.todo`, Go `t.Skip` are anchors of the class, not an exhaustive reference). A skip with no linked reason is a finding; an expected-fail that now passes (XPASS) is its own finding — the mark is stale and hides signal. Judgment: is this quarantine tracked debt or a graveyard?
- **Assertion-free tests.** Test bodies where no assertion is reached, or where the assertion checks a constant or the truthiness of an unconditional value. Ran ≠ checked: such a test proves the code doesn't crash and is silent about everything else.
- **Tautological tests.** The expected value is derived from the code under test — the test calls the same function to compute its expectation, or re-asserts what the mock was told to return. This is the same defect `tdd` names at authoring time: the test passes by construction because its expectation does not come from an independent source of truth (a known literal, a worked example, the spec). Detect it here; route prevention to `tdd`.
- **Mocks asserting mocks.** The assertion inspects only mock state while every collaborator that would exercise real code is mocked out — the test proves the mocking framework works. Judgment: a mocked boundary can be legitimate isolation; the finding is when nothing real runs between arrange and assert.
- **Snapshot rubber-stamping.** Bulk snapshot-update commits — many snapshots changed in one commit with no reviewable source change — and giant snapshots nobody could have read. Git history is the evidence route here: `git log` on the snapshot dirs, looking for update-everything commits. Judgment: a snapshot is a contract only if a human read it when it changed.
- **Coverage-without-assertion.** Where coverage data already exists, read the high-coverage files whose covering tests assert little — execution without checking. Coverage is a pointer to where to read, never the product: this skill never computes or reports a coverage number as a result.

## The mutation probe — opt-in, contained

Off by default. Run it only when the user opts in AND `git status --short` shows a clean working tree AND the test runner is confirmed working. It deliberately edits product code, so the containment protocol is the contract, not a suggestion:

1. Verify the tree is clean before the first mutation.
2. Pick 3–5 load-bearing, well-covered functions.
3. One site at a time: introduce ONE deliberate behavior mutation — flip a comparison, off-by-one a boundary, invert a branch.
4. Run only the covering tests, not the whole suite; record caught or survived.
5. Restore the site and PROVE restoration with `git diff --exit-code` (or `git checkout -- <file>` followed by that proof) before touching the next site.

A surviving mutation is a concrete finding: name the mutation and the tests that stayed green. Never commit a mutation; never leave one behind on any exit path, including a test-runner failure mid-probe; if restoration cannot be proven, say so as the first line of the report. Probe findings are sampled-and-said: "3 of 5 sampled mutations survived", never "the suite catches N% of bugs".

## Output

A findings list ordered by how badly each finding undermines trust. Every finding carries: its class, file:line, the evidence itself (the test body excerpt, the git log line, the surviving mutation), and one sentence on what the test falsely proves.

No score, no grade, no "trustworthy"/"untrustworthy" verdict — never a trust score or a health grade. The close names what was swept, what was sampled, and what was not inspected: the suite's worst lie may be in the tests nobody read. Route the fixes out: authoring-time fixes to `tdd`; per-finding tracker items to `/triage` (or `$triage`) where available; and when the sweep shows the suite cannot be trusted to guard an imminent refactor, upgrade, or migration, hand forward to `/characterization-tests` (or `$characterization-tests`) to author the net that work needs first.

## Modes and scope

- Default is the read-only static sweep; the mutation probe runs only on explicit opt-in.
- One suite or package per run. Pointed at a monorepo, narrow to the named suite — or the riskiest, and say so: this is a sweep with a boundary, not a repo audit.

## Fences

- **vs `keep-green`.** A red suite goes there — it drives a just-broken gate back to green and never asks whether green is honest. This skill takes only green suites and asks exactly that.
- **vs `tdd`.** It prevents these defects at authoring time; this detects them in the suite that already exists. Compose: every authoring-shaped fix this skill finds is `tdd`'s work, not this skill's.
- **vs `implementation-review`** (when `review-family:implementation-review` is available). It reviews a completed change against a spec plus a diff; this reads a standing suite with no change in flight.
- **vs `tech-debt-scan`.** It produces a scored, ranked backlog across a repo; this is one suite, evidence-led, deliberately unscored.
- **vs coverage tooling.** This reads what coverage points at; it never runs coverage to certify a number, and a coverage percentage is never a finding by itself.

## Done when

- All six static classes are swept, with the detection route named per class.
- Every finding carries file:line evidence and one sentence on what it falsely proves.
- The probe, if opted in, ran under the full containment protocol with restoration proven per site.
- The close names the sweep's boundaries — swept, sampled, not inspected — and renders no certificate.
- Nothing was fixed, committed, or pushed.

## Build-and-prune note

Thin in this authoring repo — its suites are small — and that silence is not evidence against it. The value is portable to every repo with a test suite, judged by that leverage and its cognitive-offload: the complete hollow-green checklist plus the evidence-per-finding discipline, summoned with one token. First-to-prune on observed mis-fire. Watch two failure shapes: drifting into a **scored health grade** — a number is `tech-debt-scan`'s register, and exactly the certificate this skill exists to refuse; and the **probe outgrowing its containment** — the moment it wants more than a handful of sampled mutations, that is a mutation-testing framework's job: use a real tool and say so. Either is prune evidence to collect, not a reason to withhold the build.
